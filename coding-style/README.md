# Coding Style

This folder contains all our code syntax guidelines per language, sometimes also per software. And each document also lists tools or good practices adopted for it (like linters, test tools, ...).

Most of our coding styles are based on the language or software standards, but we may bring some changes for convenience or clarity.

> Conventions are only relevant if they make sense or bring additional information or context by just using a syntax. If you see something that doesn't make sense to you or doesn't seem important enough to have custom conventions, you are invited to open a discussion about it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE) or even create an *Issue* for that.

Also note that we add new coding style guides as we work with new languages or software. So you may not find anything for the tools you're using, but there's more to come as our projects go!

Feel free to refer to our standards for your own projects if you want to adopt them!
